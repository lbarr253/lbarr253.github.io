        <h1>Laura Barr</h1>
        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Junior at Bob Jones University studying Fashion Design. I work for Sargent Arts as a lab monitor in the Gallery section and the Fashion Studio.</p>
         <p>
            I grew up in very rural Iowa, the closest town was fifteen minutes away with nothing and no one inbetween except for farms and farmers. At college I am active in my society and my church, Hampton Park Baptist Church. Beyond those places, my time is mostly consumed by work and creating my Capstone fashion show.   
         </p> 
         <p>
            When I do have free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, reading, embroidering, or going for walks in Falls Park or other places filled with flora.
